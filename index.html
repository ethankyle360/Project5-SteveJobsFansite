    <p>Steve Jobs was the co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc. 
        He is widely considered to be a brilliant businessman, as well as one of the greatest tech visionaries on our time.<br><br>
        The story of his life is nothing short of fascinating. After dropping out of college, he started Apple with his friend <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>
        in 1976 at the age of 21. The duo gained wealth and fame a year later for the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Apple_II">Apple II</a>, one of the first highly successful mass- <br>
        produced personal computers. This was followed by the very successful Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI (graphical user interface).
        After being ousted of Apple in 1985, he went to oversee the creation of two new <br> companies: NeXT computer and <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pixar">Pixar</a>.
        With the success of the movie Toy Story, Steve became a billionaire.
    </p>
    <p>In 1997, Steve returned to Apple. Bill Gates and Microsoft dominated the computer industry, and Apple was on the brink of extinction
        Nonetheless, <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Reality_distortion_field">Steve was a fantastic salesman</a>, and used his business acumen to slowly bring the company back to <br>
        profitability.
